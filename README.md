# Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset about student performance in exams, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). The goal of this analysis was to explore factors influencing student scores and to derive meaningful insights using **Excel**.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information about students' performance in three subjects:
- Mathematics
- Writing
- Reading

It also contains additional demographic and contextual information such as:
- Type of lunch (e.g., standard or reduced/free)
- Parental education level
- Race/ethnicity
- Whether the student took a preparation test before the exam.

You can access the dataset directly through this link: [Student Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)

## Analysis and Insights
The following analyses were performed on the dataset:

1. **Impact of Key Factors**:
   - Explored how different factors such as type of lunch, parental education level, race/ethnicity, and taking a preparation test affected the scores in mathematics, writing, and reading using pivot tables. The detailed pivot tables for these analyses are available in the [Pivot Tables File](link_to_pivot_tables_file).

2. **Score Distribution**:
   - Created histograms to visualize the distribution of scores for each subject. The detailed histograms for these analyses are available in the [Histograms File]

3. **Statistical Metrics**:
   - Calculated the **mean**, **median**, and **standard deviation** for the scores in mathematics, writing, and reading.

4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Analyzed pairwise correlations between scores in the three subjects to understand how performance in one subject relates to another.

## Files in Repository
This repository contains the following file to explore the analysis:
- **Excel File (`Students_Performance.xlsx`)**:
  - Includes the raw dataset and all analyses performed (e.g., pivot tables, histograms, statistical calculations, and correlation analysis).

## How to Use
1. Download the `Students_Performance.xlsx` file.
2. Open it in Excel to explore the pivot tables, histograms, and statistical metrics.
3. Review the dataset and replicate the analysis or use it for further research.

## Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Excel**
